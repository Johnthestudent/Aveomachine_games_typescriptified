This online game is made for educational and entertainment purposes only!

The educational part is that this is partially for practicing web programming.

The entertainment part is that I just would like to make you happy.

The game itself is a parody of Submachine sci-fi themed logical escaping game series.

Note me if you wish to fork and modify Aveomachine!

Use tsc scripts.ts command to create scripts.js, and then you can play with this game!
